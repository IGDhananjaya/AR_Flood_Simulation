**AR Flood Simulation** is an Android-based Augmented Reality application designed to visualize flood risks based on rainfall intensity. [cite_start]The simulation focuses on a factory area in **Nakhon Phanom, Thailand**, providing a real-time, interactive 3D visualization of water levels rising and spreading across the terrain[cite: 4, 31, 32].

[cite_start]This project was developed as a "Proyek Independen Mahasiswa" (Student Independent Project) at **Universitas Pendidikan Ganesha**, in collaboration with **King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT)**, Thailand[cite: 1, 12, 33].

## ℹ️ About the Project
Flooding is a complex challenge in urban areas, often caused by high rainfall exceeding drainage capacity. [cite_start]Static flood maps are often difficult for the general public to interpret[cite: 28, 30]. 

This application aims to:
1. [cite_start]Visualize flood potential interactively using AR[cite: 78].
2. [cite_start]Provide concrete educational media regarding the impact of rainfall on the environment[cite: 71].
3. [cite_start]Support disaster mitigation awareness[cite: 73].

[cite_start]The app simulates the overflow of the Mekong river and drainage systems around a specific factory site in Nakhon Phanom based on user-selected rainfall data[cite: 32].

## 🌟 Features
* [cite_start]**Marker-Based Tracking:** Uses Vuforia to detect a specific map marker of the factory area[cite: 371].
* [cite_start]**Interactive UI:** Clean interface with 'Scan AR', 'Guide', and 'About' menus[cite: 397].
* **Rainfall Simulation Selector:** Users can choose between 4 intensity levels:
    * Light
    * Medium
    * Heavy
    * [cite_start]Very Heavy[cite: 469].
* [cite_start]**Real-time 3D Animation:** Visualizes rain effects and rising water levels (puddles to severe flooding) overlaid on the physical map[cite: 365, 420].

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* [cite_start]**Engine:** Unity[cite: 190].
* [cite_start]**AR SDK:** Vuforia Qualcomm (Target Management System)[cite: 211].
* [cite_start]**3D Modeling:** Blender (for environment and water animation)[cite: 204].
* [cite_start]**Debugging:** RenderDoc (for graphics debugging)[cite: 198].
* [cite_start]**Development Method:** MDLC (Multimedia Development Life Cycle)[cite: 223].

## 🌧 Rainfall Categories
[cite_start]The simulation logic is based on the following rainfall data[cite: 323]:

| Category | Intensity (mm/6 hours) | Intensity (mm/day) | Risk Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Light** | < 7.5 | < 10 | Low risk, minimal impact |
| **Medium** | 7.5 - 35 | 10 - 50 | Potential puddles in low areas |
| **Heavy** | 35 - 70 | 50 - 100 | Urban flooding likely |
| **Very Heavy** | > 70 | > 100 | Severe flood risk, evacuation needed |

## 📲 Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
* [cite_start]Android Device with **Android 10 (API Level 29)** or higher[cite: 351].
* [cite_start]Minimum RAM: 4GB[cite: 567].
* Rear Camera functioning.

### Steps
1.  [cite_start]Download the `.apk` file from the [Releases Section](#) (or use the drive link provided in documentation [cite: 506]).
2.  Install the application on your Android device.
3.  [cite_start]**Print or Display the Marker:** You need the specific satellite map image of the Nakhon Pathom factory (found in `Assets/Marker` or the images folder of this repo)[cite: 372].
4.  [cite_start]Open the App and tap **"Scan AR"**[cite: 343].
5.  Point your camera at the marker until the 3D terrain appears.
6.  Select a rainfall button to see the flood simulation.
